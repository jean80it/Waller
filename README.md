Waller
======

Waller is evolving.

It started off as a quick and simple demo 
and now is undergoing massive refactoring 
as it's adapted to game development needs
(it's being used for development of a 
first person, dungeon exploration oriented, 
oculus rift enabled, awesome game :D ).

For this reason, while the Tiled Map loading
stuff is still here, Unity functions are
being removed, and will probably spark a 
whole new project on its own. 
Shortly (as soon as i'll get some spare 
time to housekeep) a simple demo
will be placed back in current project, while
here in the readme you'll probably find 
a pointer to new goodies. Enjoy!
